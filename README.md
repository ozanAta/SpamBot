To use Spambot.

	npm install

After node finishes downloading modules, go into your selenium folder if you did not downloaded it.
The "selenium-server-standalone-2.52.0.jar" object is 40mb itself. If you haven't dowloaded it download
from "http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/" and copy it into selenium folder.I have "standalone-2.52.0" so
if you download a different version just change the name or update the "nightwatch.json". After all is done
Go to your tests folder and open spambot.js. Type in necessary informations. Then go back and use
	
	node app.js

to start the application.

Have Fun
